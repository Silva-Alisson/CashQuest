 # Welcome Screen

This is the Welcome screen of a mobile application. It is designed to introduce the app to new users and encourage them to sign up. The screen features an engaging background image, animated illustrations, and clear calls to action.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Importing Necessary Modules

The code begins by importing necessary modules from the React Native library and other custom components.

```javascript
import { View, Text, Pressable, Image, ImageBackground } from "react-native";
import React from "react";
import { LinearGradient } from "expo-linear-gradient";
import { COLORS, SIZES, icons, images } from "../constants";
import Button from "../components/Button";
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native-safe-area-context";
import Login from "./Login";
import * as Animatable from "react-native-animatable";
```

### 2. Functional Component

The `Welcome` component is a functional component that returns the UI for the welcome screen.

### 3. Background Image

An `ImageBackground` component is used to set the background image for the screen. The image is loaded from the local assets folder.

```javascript
<ImageBackground
  source={require("../assets/fundo-figma.png")}
  style={{
    flex: 1,
    resizeMode: "cover",
    justifyContent: "center"
  }}
  resizeMode="cover"
>
```

### 4. Safe Area View

A `SafeAreaView` component is used to ensure that the content is displayed within the safe area of the device, avoiding any potential overlaps with the device's notch or status bar.

```javascript
<SafeAreaView
  style={{
    flex: 1,
    backgroundColor: COLORS.transparent,
    flexDirection: "column",
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "stretch"
  }}
>
```

### 5. Content Container

The content of the welcome screen is placed inside a `View` component with `flex: 1`. This ensures that the content takes up the entire available space.

```javascript
<View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
  {/* content */}
</View>
```

### 6. Animated Illustrations

The welcome screen features several animated illustrations of turtles. These illustrations are created using the `Image` component and positioned absolutely within the content container. The `Animatable`
